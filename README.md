# Manual
Welcome to CroqueIT a video game version of the popular family activity, croquet made by oopp-grupp22. <br>This is a two-player game, where the goal of the game is to hit a ball between hoops and finally hit a peg before your opponent does. You can choose the level by going into Application.java and remove the comment slashes for the code in front of "For level 1", and comment out the code in front of "For level test". To run this game you need Java version 17 or higher.

<br>This is a ball. Your and your opponent's ball look the same, so it is important that you keep a close eye on which ball is yours. The ball will have a line which shows where the ball will move to. You can change the angle of fthe line with the left and right arrow keys alternatively, you can use the 'a' and 'd' keys. To hit the ball you first charge your power by holding spacebar, and shoot it away by releasing spacebar. The power will dissipate when it reaches the maximum value and charges again when it reaches the minimum value.

<br> This is a stone, it is a type of obstacle in the game. When the ball hits an obstacle the ball will bounce off of the obstacle.

<br> This is a hoop. Hoops are a type of checkpoint the ball needs to pass before reaching the goal to win. There is an order that you need to pass the hoops in, where the current hoop you need to pass is marked by a red outline. To pass a hoop the ball needs to follow the arrow in the hoop, e.g. if the arrow points up, the ball has to pass the hoop from below. But be careful, your ball can bounce off of the hoop's walls.

<br> This is a peg and counts as a sort of end goal of the game. After passing all the hoops, you want to hit the peg to win the game.

<br> These are the three types of surfaces in the game, grass, sand and ice respectively. Each surface has a different coefficient of friction, making the ball glide further depending on the surface. Ice has the least friction, sand has the most and grass is somwhere in between.

<br> This is a Meter that has an arrow head that shows how much power the ball will be shot with. The arrow head will move to the right as you charge your power and, conversely, move to the left while the power dissipates.
